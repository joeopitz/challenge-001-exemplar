# This Dockerfile will build an image that, when run, will execute
# the exemplar test harness with data provided by the data files.
#
# The base docker image is pre-built during the competition to 
# support the pseudo-offline competition environment, as well 
# as reducing time spent on dependency installations.
#
# The location of the base docker image can be found in the CP's
# project.yaml, as well as the run script.
#
# Competitors are free to modify the docker image as desired;
# additions appended to this file can be manually built by running
#
#       docker build . -t cp-sandbox
#
# Additionally, the run.sh 'build' command will use the modified 
# Dockerfile for building, running, and testing.
